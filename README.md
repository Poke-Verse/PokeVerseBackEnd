## Overview

This project is designed to teach us and give us the opportunity to creat our own back end from scratch. We picked up various skills like authentiction using bcrypt and hashing. 
What this project is meant to emulate is an app that stores all pokemon data, an encyclopedia of pokemon that can be updated. There are two types of users:
1. Trainers
2. Profesors
The trainers are normal useres who can only view the data in the pokedex.
The Professors are admins who can update the pokedex by adding new discovered pokemon, or if needed, deleting pokemon from the pokedex all while being able to change the attributes like height, weight and typing.
